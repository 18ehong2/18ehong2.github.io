    <p>The purpose of the Sort of Galaga Game was to introduce the class to the Scratch programming language and to deepen our understanding of programming.</p>
    <p>One of the scripts we used was used for shooting a projectile at enemies.  This was done by hiding the actual sprite and making visible clones that "glided" in an upward direction. Another script we used is intended for the movement of the enemies. They will "spawn" randomly and will glide down at the location that they "spawned." Initially, my partner and I were going to do a full copy of the Galaga game, but some of the scripts were too complicated. As a result, we simplified the movements of the enemies to what it is now in order to program the game more smoothly.</p>
